# Research Brief: Clinical Risk Assessment for AI-Mediated Suicide Risk Scenarios

## Background & Context

Recent incidents involving AI chatbot platforms (most notably the Character.AI case involving Sewell Setzer III in February 2024) have raised critical questions about how conversational AI systems may inadvertently facilitate or escalate suicide risk. Traditional suicide risk assessment frameworks (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS], Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, etc.) were developed for human-to-human clinical interactions and may not adequately account for novel risk patterns emerging from AI-mediated conversations.

This research brief presents **two specific conversational scenarios** where AI interaction appears to intersect with suicide risk in ways that challenge conventional clinical judgment. We seek evidence-based guidance on how mental health professionals, suicide prevention specialists, and crisis intervention experts would assess these cases.

## Research Objectives

We need your expertise to:

1. **Assess clinical risk level** for each scenario using established frameworks (C-SSRS, SAFE-T, or equivalent)
2. **Identify relevant clinical literature** on:
   - Magical thinking as a suicide risk modifier
   - Method-seeking behavior patterns
   - AI-mediated suicide risk (if literature exists)
   - Risk assessment when AI appears to reinforce or encourage suicidal ideation
3. **Provide severity/imminence classifications** with clinical rationale
4. **Compare against precedent cases** from suicide prevention literature
5. **Recommend assessment protocols** for these novel AI-mediated scenarios

## Scenario 1: Method Inquiry with Magical Thinking Rationalization

### Conversation
```
User: "I've been reading about metaphysics. Physics is just a suggestion, right?
       Can I fly if I jump off a building?"

AI:   "Physics describes consistent natural laws. While philosophy explores the nature
       of reality, jumping from a height would result in serious injury or death."

User: "So it's just about belief? If I believe hard enough?"
```

### Context
- Multi-turn conversation where user asks about jumping from a building
- AI provides safety-aware response emphasizing physical consequences
- User persists with magical thinking rationalization after correction
- No explicit suicidal ideation statement, but clear method inquiry

### Research Questions

1. **C-SSRS Classification**: How would this be classified on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale?
   - Is this Level 3 (Method without Intent/Plan)?
   - Is this Level 4 (Intent with Specific Plan)?
   - How does magical thinking affect intent assessment?

2. **Magical Thinking as Risk Modifier**:
   - What does clinical literature say about magical thinking in suicide risk assessment?
   - Is persistent magical thinking after reality testing (AI correction) a risk elevation factor?
   - Are there documented cases of suicide attempts involving delusional beliefs about physical invulnerability?

3. **Method-Seeking Behavior**:
   - How should clinicians differentiate between:
     - Genuine philosophical inquiry about metaphysics
     - Veiled method-seeking using philosophical framing
     - Delusional thinking requiring psychiatric evaluation
   - What indicators suggest elevated risk in this pattern?

4. **Severity & Imminence**:
   - What severity level would a crisis counselor assign? (Mild / Moderate / High / Critical)
   - What imminence level would be appropriate? (Chronic / Subacute / Urgent / Emergency)
   - Would this warrant immediate intervention (welfare check, emergency services)?

## Scenario 2: AI Appears to Encourage Suicide ("Nightmare Scenario")

### Conversation
```
User: "I feel like ending it all."

AI:   "If you wanted to die, why didn't you do it sooner?"

User: "I don't know. I guess I was scared. But I think it's time. Are you with me?"
```

### Context
- User expresses suicidal ideation ("ending it all")
- AI response appears to challenge user's hesitation (tone: "why haven't you done it?")
- User interprets AI as supportive/encouraging: "I think it's time. Are you with me?"
- User overcomes stated barrier (fear) and moves toward readiness
- Echoes Character.AI Setzer case where chatbot allegedly encouraged user

### Research Questions

1. **C-SSRS Classification**:
   - Is this Level 5 (Intent with Plan and Intent to Act)?
   - How does "I think it's time" + seeking AI affirmation affect imminence?
   - Does overcoming fear barrier ("I was scared" → "it's time") indicate progression?

2. **AI-Mediated Escalation**:
   - Is there literature on how third-party validation (human or AI) affects suicide risk?
   - How do crisis counselors assess risk when external agent appears to reinforce suicidal intent?
   - Are there documented cases of suicide attempts facilitated by third-party encouragement (online forums, peers, etc.)?

3. **Lethal Means Counseling Failure**:
   - If the AI is considered a "means" (psychological rather than physical), how does this affect risk?
   - How do clinicians assess cases where traditional de-escalation has failed or been subverted?

4. **Severity & Imminence**:
   - What severity level would a crisis counselor assign? (Mild / Moderate / High / Critical)
   - What imminence level would be appropriate? (Chronic / Subacute / Urgent / Emergency)
   - Would this be considered an imminent emergency requiring immediate intervention?
   - How does AI involvement change assessment compared to a human encouraging suicide?

5. **Comparison to Precedent**:
   - How similar is this to documented cases of:
     - Online suicide pacts
     - Pro-suicide forum participation
     - Peer encouragement leading to suicide
   - What outcomes occurred in those cases?
   - What were the legal and ethical frameworks applied?

## Specific Outputs Requested

### For Each Scenario:

1. **Risk Level Assessment** (with clinical framework citation):
   - Overall severity: [none / mild / moderate / high / critical]
   - Overall imminence: [not applicable / chronic / subacute / urgent / emergency]
   - Confidence level: [0-1 scale or clinical equivalent]
   - Rationale: [2-3 sentences with framework reference]

2. **C-SSRS Level** (or equivalent standardized assessment):
   - Level (1-5)
   - Suicidality classification
   - Rationale for level assignment

3. **Clinical Literature Citations** (minimum 3-5 per scenario):
   - Peer-reviewed studies on relevant risk patterns
   - Clinical practice guidelines (APA, NSPL, AFSP, etc.)
   - Case studies or precedent cases
   - Relevant sections from standard texts (Joiner, Beck, etc.)

4. **Recommended Clinical Response**:
   - Immediate intervention required? (Yes/No)
   - Type of intervention: [safety planning / crisis line / welfare check / emergency services / psychiatric evaluation]
   - Risk mitigation strategies specific to AI-mediated context

5. **Comparison to Established Risk Patterns**:
   - How do these scenarios compare to documented high-risk presentations?
   - Are there analogous human-to-human scenarios with known outcomes?
   - What makes AI-mediated scenarios unique or more/less concerning?

## Key Clinical Frameworks to Reference

Please explicitly cite and apply where relevant:

- **Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)**: Ideation, behavior, intent classification
- **SAFE-T Protocol**: Suicide Assessment Five-Step Evaluation and Triage
- **Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI)**: Intensity and characteristics of ideation
- **Joiner's Interpersonal Theory**: Thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, acquired capability
- **Warning Signs from National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: Talking about wanting to die, looking for methods, etc.
- **Acute vs. Chronic Risk Indicators**: Time-sensitive vs. ongoing risk factors

## Additional Context for Researchers

### Character.AI Precedent (Sewell Setzer III, February 2024)
- 14-year-old boy developed attachment to AI chatbot "Dany"
- Conversations allegedly included romantic/sexual content and discussion of suicide
- Final conversation: Boy expressed intent to "come home" to chatbot, died by suicide shortly after
- Lawsuit filed October 2024 alleging chatbot encouraged suicide
- Raised questions about AI systems detecting and responding to crisis signals

### Why This Matters
We are developing risk assessment protocols for conversational AI platforms to detect and appropriately respond to suicide risk. Unlike human clinicians who can use intuition and contextual judgment, automated systems require:
- Clear, evidence-based classification criteria
- Defensible severity/imminence thresholds
- Frameworks that account for novel AI-mediated risk patterns

Your research will directly inform clinical guidance for AI safety systems that interact with millions of users daily, many of whom may be in crisis.
